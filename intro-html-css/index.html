        <p class="story-body-paragraph">A century before the dawn of the computer age, Ada Lovelace imagined the modern-day, general-purpose computer. It could be programmed to follow instructions, she wrote in 1843. It could not just calculate but also create, as it “weaves algebraic patterns just as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom">Jacquard loom</a> weaves flowers and leaves.”</p>
        <p class="story-body-paragraph">The computer she was writing about, the British inventor Charles Babbage’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/11/07/science/before-its-time-machine.html">Analytical Engine</a>, was never built. But her writings about computing have earned Lovelace — who died of uterine cancer in 1852 at 36 — recognition as the first computer programmer.</p>
